Content that is structured as separate types of information (specifically, task, concept, and reference topics) can help move technical information toward these characteristics and also facilitate the reuse of information.

Unfortunately, much technical **information has a reputation as the last thing people want to read** or the last thing to turn to for help

Quality characteristics for technical information must also **reflect what users expect** and want from the information.

**Freedom from** mistake or error; adherence to fact or truth

That application might **entail**, for example, installing a product, adding a row to a table, or writing a line of code.

Writers and editors need to give **foremost importance and consideration to** making the information easy to use.

Elements are the units that **physically constitute** technical information.

You need to understand **how** the **product fits into what** the user does and what new tasks the product requires of users

the users of your information are probably **less interested in** using the information or the product that it represents **than in** doing their own work.

Many of them need frequent consideration

Early in your writing, you might xxx

The information **is intertwined like** spaghetti.

Some people **equate** the term **with** usability, which they consider as broad as quality itself.

We **distinguish** this ability **from being able to** find and understand the information.

Task oriented guidelines:
> Write for the intended audience
> Present information from the user’s point of view
> Indicate a practical reason for information
> Focus on real tasks, not product functions
> Use headings that reveal the tasks
> Divide tasks into discrete sub-tasks
> Provide clear, step-by-step instructions

This information will frustrate **all but** the most patient advanced user

It is all too easy in technical writing to **lose sight of** the real tasks and **get caught up in** the tasks that are dictated by the product.

Pseudo-task headings **substitute** artificial task headings **in place of** real task headings.

Consider the **case in which** a user might need to configure additional parameters at some time **other than** during installation

You might identify **cumbersome** steps that can be **streamlined** or avoided, or steps where users are repeating actions that they’ve already performed

some steps **subordinate** to others

If you instruct users to do one action or click after another, the task can become **mind numbing** for the user

The revised set of steps also **downplays** some of the **trivial** steps by merging them or omitting them

Focus on real tasks, not product functions, try to keep your tasks free of feature clutter by eliminating steps that are superfluous to the task

Accuracy guidelines:
> Write information only when you understand it, and then verify it
> Keep up with technical changes
> Maintain consistency of all information about a subject
> Use tools that automate checking for accuracy
> Check the accuracy of references to related information

Achieving accuracy in technical information is to a writer as finding the bull’s-eye of a target is to an archer; it is an all-important goal, albeit a goal that isn’t always easy to achieve.

Regardless of how much time users take to detect an inaccuracy, their confidence in the information is **eroded**

Consider including questions to the experts in your early drafts to **solicit** the explanations that you need to fine-tune the information for users.

you **run the risk of including** more information than users need.

ensure that trademarks, product names and release levels, and **boilerplate** information are current

This duplicated effort not only increases the amount of maintenance work for the team, but it also increases the chance of inconsistency and inaccuracy

Not only does using a single source improve the accuracy of information, but it also eliminates the time that is needed to synchronize similar information.

One approach to writing technical information is to reduce **extraneous** or irrelevant information and to provide the user with only the essentials

the important information that the users need is probably spread over several pages or screens, instead of **fitting on** one or two

Completeness guidelines:
> Cover all topics that support users’ tasks, and only those topics
> Cover each topic in just as much detail as users need
> Use patterns of information to ensure proper coverage
> Repeat information only when users will benefit from it

Writing about a product is easiest when your audience is **homogeneous** — either all experienced or all inexperienced.

You don’t want to bog down the experienced user with lots of introductory information

The primary audience is not **burdened with** information that is directed at the secondary audience

When information has a specialized audience that is different from most users of the product, ignoring that majority or **relegating** them **to** a secondary position can be difficult.

You can eliminate **extraneous** information and identify redundancies by analyzing user tasks and by using and testing the information.
